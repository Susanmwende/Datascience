# Tuples and Stacks
## Tuples
Tuples are ordered lists of elements.
They are ordered, immutable, allows duplicates and defined using parentheses.
The advantages are;-
  Tuples are heterogenous,
  They are quicker to iterate, and
  They are used to keep safe read only data since they cannot be altered.
