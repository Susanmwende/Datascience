# Tuples and Stacks
## Tuples
Tuples are ordered lists of elements.
They are ordered, immutable, allows duplicates and defined using parentheses.
The advantages are;-
  Tuples are heterogenous,
  They are quicker to iterate, and
  They are used to keep safe read only data since they cannot be altered.
## Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure thet stores items a Last-in/First-out (LIFO) or First-in?Last-out(FILO).
In a stack a new element is removed from the end only while insert and delete are often push and pop.
The advantages:-
Helps manage data in the "Last in First out" method,It allows cotrol and handle memory allocation and deallocation.
It helps to automatically clean up objects.
## Queues
Queues in data structure are like real life queues where the firstperson to join in is the first to served.
They are linear data structure with dynamic size, and operations on queues are enqueue and dequeue.
The advantages are;-
Easy insertion and deletion
efficient management
consumer service
